FLUENT PYTHON

Chapter 2(Data Structures)
- Mastering list comprehensions opens the door to generator expressions, which — among other uses — can produce elements to fill-up sequences of any type
- List comprehensions, generator expressions and their siblings set and dict comprehen‐ sions now have their own local scope, like functions. Variables assigned within the ex‐ pression are local, but variables in the surrounding scope can still be referenced
- To initialize tuples, arrays and other types of sequences, you could also start from a listcomp but a genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one using the iterator protocol instead of building a whole list just to feed another constructor.
- Genexps use the same syntax as listcomps, but are enclosed in parenthesis rather than brackets
- An elegant application of tuple unpacking is swapping the values of variables without using a temporary variable: e.g. b,a = a,b
- Sometimes when we only care about certain parts of a tuple when unpacking, a dummy variable like _ is used as placeholder
- Another way of focusing on just some of the items when unpacking a tuple is to use the *

>>> a, b, *rest = range(5)
>>> a, b, rest
(0, 1, [2, 3, 4])

Note that the * prefix can be applied to exactly one variable, but it can appear in any position

- The collections.namedtuple function is a factory that produces subclasses of tuple enhanced with field names and a class name — which helps debugging

Defining and using a named tuple type

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> City = namedtuple('City', 'name country population coordinates')
>>> tokyo = City('Tokyo', 'JP', 36.933, (35.689722, 139.691667))
>>> tokyo
City(name='Tokyo', country='JP', population=36.933, coordinates=(35.689722, 139.691667))
>>> tokyo.population
36.933
>>> tokyo.coordinates
(35.689722, 139.691667)
>>> tokyo[1]
'JP'

- Slices are not just useful to extract information from sequences, they can also be used to change mutable sequences in-place, that is, without rebuilding them from scratch.
- When the target of the assignment is a slice, the right-hand side must be an iterable object, even if it has just one item.
- Repeated concatenation of immutable sequences is inefficient, because instead of just appending new items, the interpreter has to copy the whole target sequence to create a new one with the new items concatenated
- Putting mutable items in tuples is not a good idea
- The list.sort method sorts a list in-place, that is, without making a copy. In contrast, the built-in function sorted creates a new list and returns it
- If you are handling lists of numbers, arrays(instead of lists) are the way to go


Chapter 3(Dictionaries and Sets)

- A dictcomp(rehension) builds a dict instance by producing key:value pair from any iterable
- A set is a collection of unique objects. A basic use case is removing duplication:

>>> l = ['spam', 'spam', 'eggs', 'spam']
>>> set(l)
{'eggs', 'spam'}
>>> list(set(l))
['eggs', 'spam']

- In addition to guaranteeing uniqueness, the set types implement the essential set oper‐ ations as infix operators, so, given two sets a and b, a | b returns their union, a & b computes the intersection, and a - b the difference
- Smart use of set operations can reduce both the line count and the run time of Python programs, at the same time making code easier to read and reason about — by removing loops and lots of conditional logic. For example, imagine you have a large set of e-mail addresses (the haystack) and a smaller set of addresses (the needles) and you need to count how many of the nee dles occur in the haystack. Thanks to set intersection (the & operator) you can code that in a simple line:

>>> found = len(needles & haystack)

- Because a dict uses a hash table internally, and hash tables must be sparse to work, they are not space efficient
- Optimization is the altar where maintainability is sacrificed
- If you need to scan and add items to a dictionary, do it in two steps: read the dict from start to finish and collect the needed additions in a second dict. Then update the first one with it.

1. Set elements must be hashable objects.
2. Sets have a significant memory overhead.
3. Membership testing is very efficient.
4. Element ordering depends on insertion order.
5. Adding elements to a set may change the order of other elements.

The hash table implementation underlying dict and set is extremely fast. Understand‐
ing its logic explains why items are apparently unordered and may even be reordered
behind our backs. There is a price to pay for all this speed, and the price is in memory.
